# melody_selection_blending

TODOs:
1) .krn files are not still necessary, can remove them.
2) Check multithreading for tracking progress.
3) Make UI room for changing evolution parameters (and showing progress).
4) Download session button/functionality.
5) Text-input email to get all single-scope blends.
